            <h2>At Southampton Tennis Academy we put the player at the centre of everything we do.</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>We believe that <em>tennis is a game for life</em>  and it's our mission to help you develop as a player and a person on and off the court.</h3> 
            <br>
            <p>We have outstanding adult and junior programmes tailor-made to individuals of all ages and abilities. All of our staff are trained to provide you with everything you will need to improve your game and take it to the next level whether you are a junior club player or a world-ranked adult. STA Tennis is based upon three core principles which we focus on to bring out the best in your game: <strong>Competition,</strong> <strong>Coaching</strong> and <strong>Practice.</strong> You can learn more about how we implement these below.</p>

                    We offer a comprehensive internal competition programme for all of our players, regardless of level.

Our coaches are always on hand to advise and help prepare our players for the rigors of competition.
